Azure Service Bus Disaster Recovery Setup Options
1. Geo-Disaster Recovery (GeoDR)
Geo-DR is a metadata-only replication mechanism in Azure Service Bus that enables namespace-level disaster recovery using an alias.
Key Features:
• ✅ Replicates metadata only (queues, topics, filters, authorization rules)
• ❌ Does not replicate messages
• ✅ Allows manual failover to secondary namespace
• ✅ Uses alias to mask failover behind a consistent name
• ✅ No code changes needed during failover
• ⚠️ One-way replication only; failover is not reversible
• ⚠️ Resource-level settings (e.g., RBAC, private endpoints, VNETs) not replicated
• ✅ GA (Generally Available) feature
• ❌ Not supported in Standard tier — Premium tier only
Pros:
• Mature and production-ready
• Fast namespace failover with alias
• No impact on client connection strings
Cons:
• No message continuity
• Requires manual re-pairing post-failover
• Not suitable for scenarios needing message durability
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Geo-Replication (Preview)
Geo-Replication (in preview) allows entity + message replication across Azure Service Bus namespaces.
 
Key Features:
• ✅ Replicates both metadata and messages
• ✅ Supports synchronous or asynchronous replication modes
• ✅ Reversible failover (both directions)
• ✅ Clients use same hostname after failover
• ⚠️ Currently in preview — not recommended for production
• ❌ No support for private endpoints, auto-scaling, encryption
• ✅ Designed for low RTO/RPO scenarios
Pros:
• Full business continuity (metadata + data)
• Bi-directional failover for high availability
• Allows zero-data-loss configurations
Cons:
• Preview-only (as of July 2025)
• Missing support for several production features
• Requires Premium tier
• Complexity in operations and DR planning

4. Recommended Usage
✅ Use Geo-DR When:
• You require namespace continuity (queues/topics)
• Your system can tolerate message loss in DR scenarios
• You need a mature, production-grade DR solution
• You want to keep things simple (no data sync complexity)
✅ Use Geo-Replication When:
• You want full message and metadata replication
• You are okay with preview-level support
• You need zero-data-loss and active-active/standby DR strategy
• You’re building new systems and can tolerate evolving features
 
5. Hybrid DR Strategy (Recommended for Enterprise)
For organizations needing both namespace and message durability, consider combining both approaches:
• Use Geo-DR for fast alias-based namespace failover
• Use custom Function Apps or Event Grid to backup and mirror messages between primary and secondary namespaces
• Optionally: leverage Geo-Replication (once GA) to simplify dual-write logic
